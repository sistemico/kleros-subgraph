# Kleros Subgraph

[Kleros](https://kleros.io/) is a decentralized application built on top of Ethereum that works as a decentralized
third party to arbitrate disputes in every kind of contract, from very simple to highly complex
ones. It relies on game theoretic incentives to have jurors rule cases correctly. The result is a
dispute resolution system that renders ultimate judgments in a fast, inexpensive, reliable and
decentralized way.
